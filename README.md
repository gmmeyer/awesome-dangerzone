#My awesome configuration

This is my [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/) configuration. It's a bit of a mess right now, but I'm working on cleaning it up and refactoring it.

I need to separate out the init into separate files.

This is running, stably, on 3.5.6, the latest version of Awesome.
