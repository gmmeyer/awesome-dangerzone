#My awesome configuration

I was feeling a bit bored with my old configuration. Or maybe, and this might just be why I'm a linux user, I'm just a masochist. But, I started using [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/) as my windows manager! Oh what joyous fun. It's nothing much yet, but I'm working on the config.

Maybe I'll have something here to show off sometime (I might already and just haven't been very good about updating the readme) but, for now, this is mostly just here for backup.
